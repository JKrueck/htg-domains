# A compilation of Hard-To-Ground domains

* The three versions of the `genome-edit-distance` domain are taken from Patrik Haslum's
[website](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~patrik/#resources). The instances appearing in the IPC'14
seem to correspond to the easiest instances of the `-split` version here.

* The `organic-synthesis` benchmarks are different versions of the same problem. The instances 
appearing in the IPC'18 are no exactly these ones, but simpler instances.

* The `pipesworld-tankage-nosplit` folder contains the *non-split* version of the 
`pipesworld-tankage`, as it features e.g. in the downward-benchmark repos.

* The `large-instances-aaai19` folder contains larger instances of standard benchmarks

* The `logistics` folders just contains some handmade instances for testing purposes.
