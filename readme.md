# A compilation of Hard-To-Ground domains

* The three versions of the `genome-edit-distance` domain are taken from Patrik Haslum's
[website](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~patrik/#resources). The instances appearing in the IPC'14
seem to correspond to the easiest instances of the `-split` version here.

* The `organic-synthesis` benchmarks are different versions of the same problem. The instances 
appearing in the IPC'18 are no exactly these ones, but simpler instances.

* The `pipesworld-tankage-nosplit` folder contains the *non-split* version of the 
`pipesworld-tankage`, as it features e.g. in the downward-benchmark repos.

* The `gnad-et-al-aaai19-large-instances` folder contains larger instances of standard benchmarks,
sourced from 


    Gnad, D., Torralba, A., Domínguez, M., Areces, C., & Bustos, F. (2019).
    Learning how to ground a plan–partial grounding in classical planning.
    In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (Vol. 33, pp. 7602-7609).

* The `logistics` folders just contains some handmade instances for testing purposes.

* The `childsnack-contents` folder contains a modification of the original Childsnack that adds contents to sandwiches (instead of just tracking the bread type). 

* The `visitall-multidimensional` folder contains an extension of the original visitall domain that interchanges the 2D-grid with a n-dimensional hypercube.

* The `*-large-simple` folders contain larger instances of standard benchmarks with a low goal amount.
